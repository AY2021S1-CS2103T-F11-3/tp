## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an assignment).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `UI` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the data in ProductiveNUS.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Assignment>` and an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save assignment and lesson data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Implemented\] Import timetable feature
The user can import information about their lessons into ProductiveNUS using their NUSMods timetable URL.

#### Reasons for implementation:
Users may find it inconvenient to constantly refer to their NUSMods timetable whenever they want to check if they are
available on a specific date and time. By giving users the option to add their lesson information into ProductiveNUS,
it will help increase the user's convenience as all their academic related schedule can be found in one place.

ProdutiveNUS can also better schedule the user's work with their timetable information available, avoiding any clashes
in schedule.

#### Current implementation:
- The import command is a typical command used in ProductiveNUS. It extends `Command` and overrides the method `execute`
in `CommandResult`. `ImportCommandParser` implements `Parser<ImportCommand>` and it parses the user's input to return an
`ImportCommand` object. The constructor of `ImportCommand` takes in the prefix url/ and the user's NUSMods timetable
url.

- A call to `TimetableRetriever` will be made. `TimetableRetriever` takes the user's timetable data which was parsed by
`ImportCommandParser` and makes a HTTP GET request to NUSMods API. NUSMods sends `TimetableRetriever` the relevant JSON
data. The data is parsed and returns as a list of `Lessons`.

The following sequence diagram shows the sequence when LogicManager executes `import` command.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `import url/URL` Command](images/ImportSequenceDiagram.png)

1. The `execute` method of `LogicManager` is called when a user keys in an input into the application and `execute`
takes in the input.
2. The `parseCommand` method of `ProductiveNusParser` parses the user input and returns an initialized
`ImportCommandParser` object and further calls the `parse` method of this object to identify the URL in the user input.
3. It calls the `TimetableUrlParser` with the URL and it returns a `TimetableData` object.
4. `ImportCommandParser` returns an `ImportCommand` object.
5. There is return call to `LogicManager` which then calls the overridden `execute` method of `ImportCommand`.
6. The `execute` method of `ImportCommand` will call the `retrieveLessons` method from `TimetableRetriever`, which
 returns a list of lessons to be added.
7. The `execute` method returns a `CommandResult` object.

### \[Implemented\] Schedule an assignment

The user can input a deadline and expected time for an assignment to get a suggested start time and end time to work on the assignment.
The suggested time will be within working hours from 6am to 11pm local time.
The expected hours for an assignment ranges from 1 to 5 hours.
The suggested time will not class with any of the suggested time for other assignments and lessons.

#### Reasons for Implementation

User may find it convenient to be suggested a time slot where they can do their assignment before a specific date and at a
specific time which he is free from all lessons and other assignment.

#### Current Implementation
- The schedule command is a typical command used in ProductiveNUS. It extends `Command` and overrides the method `execute` in `CommandResult`.

- `ScheduleCommandParser` implements `Parser<ScheduleCommand>` and it parses the user's input to return a `ScheduleCommand` object.

- The constructor of `ScheduleCommand` takes in (`Index`, `ExpectedHours`, `DoBefore`) where `Index` is a zero-based index
with the prefix (expected/, dobefore/) in the user's input. 
 
- The suggested schedule will be display in the assignment card shown in list.
 
It implements the following operations:
* `schedule 3 expected/2 dobefore/01-01-2001 0101` - Suggest schedule for the 3rd assignment in the displayed assignment list
with expected hours of 2 and need to be done before 01:01 01-01-2001.
* `schedule 2 expected/5 dobefore/02-02-2002 0202` - Suggest schedule for the 2nd assignment in the displayed assignment 
with expected hours of 5 and need to be done before 02:02 02-02-2002.

#### Usage Scenario

A usage scenario would be when a user wants to schedule an assignment.

1. The `execute` method of `LogicManager` is called when a user keys in an input into the application and `execute` takes in the input.
2. The `parseCommand` method of `ProductiveNusParser` parses the user input and returns an initialized `ScheduleCommandParser` object and further calls the `parse` method of this object to identify keywords and prefixes in the user input.
3. If user input is valid, it returns a `ScheduleCommand` object, which takes in a predicate. (`ExpectedHours` in this example user input)
4. There is return call to `LogicManager` which then calls the overridden `execute` method of `ScheduleCommand`.
6. The `execute` method returns a `ScheduleResult` object.

### Find by specific fields feature

The user can find assignments by providing keywords of the following fields:
- Name of assignment
- Module code of assignment
- Due date or time of assignment
- Priority of assignment

The user can find assignments with single or multiple keywords of the same type of field.

It implements the following operations:
* `find n/Lab` - Finds assignments with a name that has "Lab".
* `find mod/CS2100 CS2103T` - Finds assignments from the module CS2100 and CS2103T.
* `find d/1200 24-10-2020` - Finds assignments with due time 1200 (regardless of date), and with due date 24-10-2020 (regardless of time).
* `find p/HIGH` - Finds assignments of high priority.

#### Reasons for Implementation

If the user can search by only one field, it would restrict the user's process of viewing assignments.
As a student user, the following scenarios are likely:
- The user wants to search for assignments with the highest priority, so that he knows what assignments to complete first.
- The user wants to search for assignments due on a particular date or time, so that he can complete it and submit his assignment on time.
- The user wants to view the details of one particular assignment with a specific name.
- The user wants to complete all assignments under a certain module first, before moving on with his next task.

We thus concluded that finding by specific fields would be beneficial for users, and it would make it easier and more convenient for them to view assignments based on their needs.

#### Current Implementation

##### Prefixes used in identifying keywords
The use of prefixes before keywords allows for validation of keywords in the user's input, with Regular Expressions.

The following prefixes are used to identify the fields and its keywords:
- `/n` for Name
- `/mod` for Module code
- `/d` for Due date or time
- `/p` for Priority

##### Predicate classes 
The following Predicate classes implements `Predicate<Assignment>` and are used when the user inputs keywords of its assigned field:
- NameContainsKeywordsPredicate
- ModuleCodeContainsKeywordsPredicate
- DeadlineContainsKeywordsPredicate
- PriorityContainsKeywordsPredicate

Given below is the class diagram of these Predicate classes:

------ CLASS DIAGRAM---------



##### FindCommand Class
- `FindCommand` extends abstract class `Command` and overrides the method `execute` in `CommandResult`.
- The constructor of `FindCommand` takes in a Predicate depending on the prefix or keywords in the user's input. 
- This class contains static `String` attributes of error messages to be displayed in the event of invalid user input.

##### FindCommandParser Class
- The `FindCommandParser` class contains private methods to parse each type of keyword field, and to check for valid input format.
- `FindCommandParser` implements `Parser<FindCommand>` and it parses the user's input to return a `FindCommand` object.

Given below is the class diagram of `FindCommandParser` class.






------ CLASS DIAGRAM---------










#### Usage Scenario

The following is a usage scenario of when a user wants to find assignments with the name 'Lab'.

1. The `execute` method of `LogicManager` is called when a user keys in an input into the application and `execute` takes in the input.
2. The `parseCommand` method of `ProductiveNusParser` parses the user input and returns an initialized `FindCommandParser` object and further calls the `parse` method of this object to identify keywords and prefixes in the user input.
3. If user input is valid, it returns a `FindCommand` object, which takes in `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` with the list of keywords.
4. There is return call to `LogicManager` which then calls the overridden `execute` method of `FindCommand`.
5. The `execute` method of `FindCommand` will call the `updateFilteredAssignmentList` method and then the `getFilteredAssignmentListMethod` of the `Model` object.
6. The `execute` method returns a `CommandResult` object.


Given below is the sequence diagram for the interactions within `LogicManager` for the `execute(find n/Lab)` API call.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find n/Lab` Command](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)


### \[Implemented\] Remind assignments feature
The user can set reminders for a single assignment or multiple assignments at a time.
Reminded assignments will be displayed in the `Your Reminders` section in ProductiveNUS for easy referral.

#### Reasons for Implementation
It is likely that the user will want to receive reminders for assignments with deadlines that are far away, so that he will not forget to complete those assignments. It is also likely that the user will want to receive reminders for assignments that require more attention, so that he will know which assignments to focus on and plan his time accordingly.

Displaying reminded assignments in a list separate from the main assignment list allows for easy referral and is hence more convenient for the user.

#### Current Implementation
- The remind command extends abstract class `Command` and overrides the method `execute` in `CommandResult`.
- `RemindCommandParser` implements `Parser<RemindCommand>` and it parses the user's input to return a `RemindCommand` object.
- The constructor of `RemindCommand` takes in `List<Index>`, and each `Index` in `List<Index>` is parsed from the zero based index of the user's input.

It implements the following operations:
* `remind 3` - Sets reminders for the 3rd assignment in the displayed assignment list.
* `remind 1 4` - Sets reminders for the 1st and 4th assignment in the displayed assignment list.

#### Usage Scenario
The following is a usage scenario of when the user wants to set reminders for the 2nd and 3rd assignment in their displayed assignment list.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("remind 2 3")` API call.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `remind 2 3` Command](images/RemindMultipleSequenceDiagram.png)

1. `execute("remind 2 3")` of `LogicManager` calls the `parseCommand` method of `ProductiveNusParser`.
1. `parseCommand("remind 2 3")` parses the String `"remind 2 3"` and returns an initialized `RemindCommandParser` object. 
1. `parseCommand("remind 2 3")` calls the `parse` method in `RemindCommandParser` and checks if indexes inputted are valid.
1. If the indexes are valid, it returns a `RemindCommand` object, which takes in `List<Index>` containing `Index` `2` and `3`.
1. There is return call to `LogicManager` which then calls the overridden `execute` method of `RemindCommand`.
1. The `execute` method of `RemindCommand` will call the `checkForDuplicatedIndexes` method of `CommandLogic` to check for duplicated indexes 
1. The `checkForInvalidIndexes` method of the `CommandLogic` is then called to check for any indexes not found in the displayed assignment list.
1. The `setAssignment` method of `Model` is repeatedly called, once for each `Index` in `List<Index>`. In this case, the loop terminates after 2 times.
1. A `CommandResult` object is returned from `execute()`.


### List by days feature

The user can list all his assignments with `list` without a subsequent argument index, or list assignments with 
deadlines within a number of days from the current date (and time), with this number being an argument index after `list`.

It implements the following operations:
* `list` - Lists all assignments
* `list 2` - List all assignments with deadline within 2 days (48 hours) from the current date (and time).
For example, if the current date and time is 22/10/2020 1200, assignments with deadlines from this date and time to
24/10/2020 1200 will be displayed.

#### Reasons for Implementation
- As a student user, he will want to view assignments that are due within days from the current date, so that he will know which assignments to complete first in order to meet the deadlines.
- It is different from the `find` command as users can list all assignments with deadlines within a time period (from the current date to a number of days later),
whereas finding assignments by date or time will only display assignments due on this particular day or time.

#### Current Implementation

##### ListCommand Class
- It extends the abstract class `Command` and overrides the method `execute` in `CommandResult`.
- The constructor of `ListCommand` takes in an `Index` which is parsed from the zero based index of the user's input.
- The class contains a private method `showLimitedAssignments()` that returns a `Predicate<Assignment>`. This method will filter 
assignments to be displayed based on the argument index in the user's input.
- The class also contains a private attribute `numberOfDays` of type `Index` and `String` attributes of messages to be displayed to the user.

##### ListCommandParser Class
- `ListCommandParser` implements `Parser<ListCommand>`. It has a method `parse` which parses the user's input to return a `ListCommand` object.
- With the use of Regular Expressions to identify index arguments present in the input, it sets a boolean variable `hasArgumentIndex`.

#### Usage scenario
The following is a usage scenario of when the user wants to list assignments that are due within the next 3 days from now.

1. `execute("list 3")` of `LogicManager` calls the `parseCommand` method of `ProductiveNusParser`.
 1. `parseCommand("list 3")` parses the String `"list 3"` and returns an initialized `ListCommandParser` object. 
 1. `parseCommand("List 3")` calls the `parse` method in `ListCommandParser` to return a `ListCommand` object.
 1. There is return call to `LogicManager` which then calls the overridden `execute` method of `ListCommand`.
 1. The `execute` method of `ListCommand` will call the `updateFilteredAssignmentList` method of the object `model`, which takes in `showLimitedAssignments` predicate.
 1. If `getZeroBased` value of `Index` attribute `numberOfDays` is 0, it would take in `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_ASSIGNMENT`. Else, it would take in `showLimitedAssignments` to return assignments that passes this predicate.
 1. The `execute()` method returns a `CommandResult` object.
 
 Given below is the sequence diagram for the interactions within `LogicManager` for the `execute(list 3)` API call.


DIAGRAM



### Delete multiple assignments feature
The user can delete one or multiple assignments at a time.

It implements the following operations:
* `delete 1` - Deletes the 1st assignment in the displayed assignment list.
* `delete 1 2 3` - Deletes the 1st, 2nd and 3rd assignments in the displayed assignment list.

#### Reasons for Implementation
It will provide convenience to users who want to delete more than one assignment at a time, and it makes the process of removing completed assignments faster.

#### Current Implementation

##### DeleteCommand class 
- It extends the abstract class `Command` and overrides the method `execute` in `CommandResult`.
- `DeleteCommandParser` implements `Parser<DeleteCommand>` and it parses the user's input to return a `DeleteCommand` object.
- It contains a private attribute ` targetIndexes`, of type `List<Index>`. It stores a list of indexes of respective assignments to be deleted.  
- The constructor of `DeleteCommand` takes in a `List<Index>`. 

##### DeleteCommandParser Class
- `DeleteCommandParser` implements `Parser<DeleteCommand>`. 
- It has a method `parse` which parses the user's input by calling `parseIndexes` method of `ParserUtil`, to return `parsedIndexes` of type `List<Index>`.
- The `parse` method returns a `DeleteCommand` object that takes in `parsedIndexes`.

##### Design Considerations
To delete an assignment, it calls the `deleteAssignment` method of `model`.

When deleting multiple assignments, it calls this method repeatedly with a for loop as shown in the following sequence diagram under "Usage Scenario".
Since the index of assignments in the list will update after each delete in the loop, we sorted the list from the largest index to the smallest, and implemented deleting of assignments from the largest index in the list to maintain order.

#### Usage Scenario
The following is a usage scenario of when the user wants to delete the first and second assignment in his displayed assignment list.
1. `execute("delete 1 2")` of `LogicManager` calls the `parseCommand` method of `ProductiveNusParser`.
 1. `parseCommand("delete 1 2")` parses the String `"delete 1 2"` and returns an initialized `DeleteCommandParser` object. 
 1. `parseCommand("delete 1 2")` calls the `parse` method in `DeleteCommandParser` which parses the user input into `List<Index>`. This is by calling the static method `parseIndexes()` of `ParserUtil`.
 1. If the indexes are valid, it returns a `DeleteCommand` object, which takes in `parsedIndexes`, of type `List<Index>` containing `Index` `1` and `2`.
 1. There is return call to `LogicManager` which then calls the overridden `execute` method of `DeleteCommand`.
 1. The `execute` method of `DeleteCommand` will call the `checkForDuplicatedIndexes` method of `CommandLogic` to check for duplicated indexes. 
 1. The `execute()` method then calls `checkForInvalidIndexes` method of the `CommandLogic` to check for any indexes not found in the displayed assignment list.
 1. The `deleteAssignment` method of `Model` is repeatedly called, once for each `Index` in `List<Index>`. In this case, the loop terminates after 2 times.
 1. The `execute()` method returns a `CommandResult` object.
 
 Given below is the sequence diagram for the interactions within `LogicManager` for the `execute(delete 1 2)` API call.

### \[Coming up\] Help feature

### \[Implemented\] Undo

The user can undo the most recent command that changes the data of the assignments or lessons.

#### Reasons for Implementation
It is likely that the user might type in command mistakenly will want to go the previous state.
Instead of using a combination of adding, deleting, editting, ..., a single undo command will 
help solving the problem easily.

#### Current Implementation
- The undo command is a typical command used in ProductiveNUS. 
- It extends `Command` and overrides the method `execute` in `CommandResult`.

It implements the following operations:
* `Undo`â€‰â€”â€‰Undo the most recent command that changes the data of the assignments or lessons.

#### Usage Scenario

A usage scenario would be when a user wants to undo the most recent command that changes the data of the assignments

1. The `execute` method of `LogicManager` is called when a user keys in an input into the application and `execute` takes in the input.
2. The `execute` calls the `UndoCommand`.
4. There is return call to `LogicManager` which then calls the overridden `execute` method of `UndoCommand`.
5. The `execute` method of `UndoCommand` will call the `getPreviousModel` of the `Model` object and reassign `Model`.
6. The `execute` method returns a `CommandResult` object.

### \[Implemented\] Updating of Upcoming tasks in real time

The displayed task list under `Upcoming tasks` updates in real time when the deadline of an assignment or the end time of a lesson has passed.

#### Reasons for Implementation
It is likely that the user will refer to the `Upcoming tasks` to quickly view what is up next on their academic schedule. It is hence important that the `Upcoming tasks` accurately reflect what is next on their academic schedule.

#### Current Implementation
- The updating of `Upcoming tasks` in real time is implemented with **multithreading**.
- The GUI of ProductiveNUS is implemented using JavaFX. Hence, Thread safety using synchronised thread actions cannot be achieved as JavaFx is modelled to execute on a **single JavaFX-Launcher thread.**
- Therefore, this feature makes use of `javafx.concurrent.Task<V>` for multithreading operations, which is designed to handle multithreading operations in JavaFX applications in a **thread-safe manner**.
- A `Timer` object is used alongside `javafx.concurrent.Task` to periodically check `Upcoming tasks` every second. The `Timer` object has `isDaemon` set to true.
- If the deadline of the upcoming assignment or the end time of the upcoming lesson has passed, the `updateTasks()` method in `AddressBook` is called.

Below is an Activity Diagram illustrating the flow of activities when the application starts up.

                               ------------------------------Activity diagram illustrating multithreading (will add later)--------------------------------

### \[Implemented\] Adding an assignment feature

The user can add an assignment by providing keywords of the following fields:
- Name of assignment
- Module code of assignment
- Deadline of assignment (contains both due time and due date)
- Priority level (Optional)
- Remind (Optional)

It implements the following operations:
- `add n/Lab 3 mod/CS2100 d/24-10-2020 2359` - Adds an assignment with name Lab 3, module code CS2100, due time 2359, and with due date 24-10-2020.
- `add n/Lab 3 mod/CS2100 d/24-10-2020 2359 p/HIGH` - Adds a high priority assignment with name Lab 3, module code CS2100, due time 2359 and with due date 24-10-2020.  
- `add n/Lab 3 mod/CS2100 d/24-10-2020 2359 p/MEDIUM remind` - Adds a medium priority assignment with name Lab 3, module code CS2100, due time 2359, due date 24-10-2020, and with reminders set.

#### Reasons for Implementation

Being able to add an assignment is essential for the user to manage his/her academic tasks. 
As a student user, the following scenarios are likely:
- The user wants to add an assignment with a certain priority level attach to it, so he/she knows how urgent the assignment is.
- The user wants to add an assignment and wants the assignment to appear directly in his/her Reminders list right away since it's something important.
- The user wants to add an assignment with a certain priority level and also wants the assignment to appear directly in his/her Reminders list right away.

We decided to allow the user to include the priority level and remind tag if he/she wants to do so. We understand that not all users will 
know the priority level of the assignment at the point he/she is adding the assignment and thus we made the priority level and remind keywords optional.

#### Current Implementation

##### Prefixes used in identifying keywords
The use of prefixes before keywords facilitates the extraction of keywords from the user's input and allow keywords to be validated subsequently.

The following prefixes are used to identify the type of keywords:
- `/n` for Name keyword
- `/mod` for Module code keyword
- `/d` for Deadline keyword
- `/p` for Priority keyword
- `/remind` for Remind keyword 

##### AddCommand Class
The `AddCommand` class extends abstract class `Command` and is responsible for adding assignments based on the user's input keywords.
It contains static `String` attributes of success and error messages to be displayed in the event of a valid and invalid user input.
It also contains an `Assignment` attribute, `toAdd`. The constructor of `AddCommand` takes in an `Assignment` and `toAdd` is initialized to this value.

It overrides the method `execute` to return a `CommandResult` object, which represents the result of the AddCommand execution.
In the `execute` method, it checks whether the `toAdd` assignment already exist in `ProductiveNus` and throws a `CommandException` if it does.
If the `ToAdd` assignment is unique, it calls the `addAssignment` method of a `Model` object, `model`, it takes in, and adds the assignment `toAdd`.

##### AddCommandParser Class
The `AddCommandParser` class implements `Parser<AddCommand>` and it is responsible for parsing the user's input arguments with the `parse` method to create a new `AddCommand` object.
It contains a private method `ArePrefixesPresent` which checks for the presence of non-optional prefixes and keywords.
If there are missing or invalid keywords, a `ParseException` will be thrown.

The `parse` method takes in a String of user input, `args` and contains a `ArgumentMultimap` object, `argMultimap`.
Regular expressions are used to identify whether optional keywords like `remind` and `/p` are present.
The remind keyword is identified using `.*\bremind\b.*` while priority keyword is identified using `.*\bp/\b.*`.
In the event that the remind keyword is present, `remind` will be removed from `args` before the parsing of the other keywords by `argMultimap`.
The `tokenize` method of `ArgumentTokenizer` will be called. The keywords are parsed and return as `argMultimap`.
The keywords are subsequently extracted from `argMultimap` to create a new `Assignment` object, `assignment`, which is used
to return a new `AddCommand` object. 
 
In the event that the keywords have an invalid format, such as the `Deadline` keyword not being in the required `dd-MM-yyyy HHmm` form for example,
a `ParseException` will be thrown. 

#### Usage Scenario
The following is a usage scenario when a user wants to add an assignment with the name 'Lab', module 'CS2103', and deadline '10-10-2020 2359'.

1. `execute ("add n/Lab mod/CS2103 d/10-10-2020 2359")` of `LogicManager` calls the `parseCommand` method of `ProductiveNusParser`.
2. `parseCommand("add n/Lab mod/CS2103 d/10-10-2020 2359")` parses the String `"add n/Lab mod/CS2103 d/10-10-2020 2359"` and returns an initialized `AddCommandParser` object.
3. `parseCommand("add n/Lab mod/CS2103 d/10-10-2020 2359")` calls the `parse` method in `AddCommandParser` which parses the user input into `Name`, `Time` and `ModuleCode`.
 This is done by calling the methods `tokenize` followed by `getValue` of `ArgumentMultimap`.
4. If user input is valid, a `Assignment` object will be created, and it will be used to return a `AddCommand` object.
5. There is a return call to `LogicManager` which then calls the overridden `execute` method of `AddCommand`.
6. The `execute` method then calls `hasAssignment` of `model` to check if the `toAdd` assignment is a duplicate.
7. If the assignment is not a duplicate, the `execute` method of `AddCommand` will call the `addAssignment` method of the `Model` object.
8. The `execute` method returns a `CommandResult` object.

Given below is the sequence diagram for the interactions within `LogicManager` for the `execute ("add n/Lab mod/CS2103 d/10-10-2020 2359")` API call.

### \[Implemented\] Marking assignments as done and Setting reminders for assignments features

Both features are implemented in a similar way, though the reasons for implementation differs.There are also some differences in the implementation, which will be pointed out along the way.

##### Marking assignments as done and Setting reminders for assignments
The user can mark one or multiple assignments as done at a time. Similarly, the user can also set reminders for one or multiple assignments at a time. 
Reminded assignments will be displayed in the `Your Reminders` section in ProductiveNUS for easy referral.


It implements the following operations:
- `done 1` - Marks the 1st assignment in the displayed assignment list as done.
- `done 1 2 3` - Marks the 1st, 2nd and 3rd assignments in the displayed assignment list as done.
- `remind 2` - Set reminders for the 2nd assignment in the displayed assignment list and adds it to `Your reminders`.
- `remind 1 2 3` - Set reminders for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd assignments in the displayed assignment list amd adds them to `Your reminders`.

#### Reasons for Implementation

##### Marking assignments as done
User may find it convenient to mark assignments that he/she has completed as done. Without the done feature, it will be difficult for the user to keep track of uncompleted assignments.
As a student user, the following scenarios are likely:
- The user has completed an assignment and wants to indicate that the particular assignment in his/her assignment list has been completed.
- The user has completed several assignments and wants to indicate that those assignments have been completed.
 
We realised that users would have to delete completed assignments from their assignment list in order to keep track of their uncompleted assignments.
At the same, we understand that users might forget about the completed assignments after deleting them and thus we decided to implement the done feature
so users can easily find out what are their uncompleted assignments without deleting the completed ones.

##### Setting reminders for assignments
Users may find it convenient to display certain assignments in another section, apart from their main assignment list, so they can refer to those assignments easily.
As a student user, the following scenarios are likely:
- The user wants to display an assignment in another section of the GUI for his/her easy referral.
- The user wants to display multiple assignments in another section of the GUI for his/her easy referral.

We decided to create a `Your reminders` section in our GUI, allowing users to display only the assignments that have reminders set.

#### Current Implementation

##### DoneCommand Class and RemindCommand Class
The `DoneCommand` and `RemindCommand` class extends abstract class `Command` and are responsible for marking assignments as done or setting reminders to assignments respectively, based on the user's input indexes.
Both classes contain static `String` attributes of messages to be displayed to the user, and a `List<Index>` attribute, `targetIndexes`. Both constructors of `DoneCommand` and `RemindCommand` takes in a `List<Index>` argument and `targetIndexes` is initialized to this value.

Both `DoneCommand` and `RemindCommand` classes overrides the method `execute` to return a `CommandResult` object, which represents the result of the DoneCommand and RemindCommand execution respectively.
In the `execute` method, `targetIndexes` is first passed into the `checkForDuplicatedIndexes` method followed by the `checkForInvalidIndexes` method, where both methods are in `CommandLogic`.
If there are duplicated or invalid indexes found, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
Next, each of the `Index`, `targetIndex`, in `targetIndexes` will be used to obtain its corresponding assignment in the `FilteredAssignmentList` of the `Model` object, `model`, by calling the `get` method.

The description below describes how each assignment obtained is validated and used to create a similar assignment before being added to another `List<Assignment`, which contains all the assignments with the updated details.

*Verifying that the assignment is valid*
For `RemindCommand`, it will check whether the assignment obtained has already been reminded by calling the `isReminded` method of `Assignment`.
For `DoneCommand`, it will check whether the assignment obtained has already been marked as done by calling the `isMarkedDone` method of `Assignment`.
There will also be another check for both classes to ensure that the assignment obtained exist in the `model` by calling the `hasAssignment` method of `model`.
If the assignment obtained is invalid, a `CommandException` will be thrown after all assignments have been checked.

*Creating an assignment*
Next, the assignment obtained will be used to create an assignment with the updated details, `assignmentMarkedDone` or `remindedAssignment`, for `DoneCommand` and `RemindCommand` respectively.
The assignment is created using a private method called `createRemindedAssignment`, in `RemindCommand` or `createAssignmentMarkedDone`, in `DoneCommand`.

*Updating the model*
`setAssignment` method of `model` will be called to replace the assignment with the created assignment, `assignmentMarkedDone` or `remindedAssignment`, for `DoneCommand` and `RemindCommand` respectively
`updateFilteredAssignmentList` method of `model` will also be called to update the list shown to the user.

The created assignment will be added to the `List<Assignment`, `assignmentsToRemind` or `assignmentsToMarkDone`, for `RemindCommand` and `DoneCommand` respectively.

The above process repeats until all assignments corresponding to all indexes in `targetedIndexes` are accounted for.
A new `CommandResult` containing `assignmentsToRemind` or `assignmentsToMarkDone` list will be returned for `RemindCommand` and `DoneCommand` respectively.

##### DoneCommandParser Class and RemindCommandParser Class
The `DoneCommandParser` class and `RemindCommandParser` class implements `Parser<DoneCommand>` and `Parser<RemindCommand>` respectively, which is responsible for parsing the user's input arguments.
The user's arguments will be parsed using the `parse` method to create a new `DoneCommand` and `RemindCommand` object for `DoneCommandParser` and `RemindCommandParser` class respectively.
It calls `parseIndexes` method from `ParserUtil` class to parse the string user input into multiple `Index` which is then stored in a `List<Index>` named `parsedIndexes`.
 A `ParseException` is caught if the parsing is unsuccessful.
 
#### Usage Scenario

##### Marking assignments as done
The following is a usage scenario when a user wants to mark the first and third assignment in his/her displayed assignment list as done.

1. `execute ("done 1 3")` of `LogicManager` calls the `parseCommand` method of `ProductiveNusParser`.
2. `parseCommand("done 1 3")` parses the String `"done 1 3"` and returns an initialized `DoneCommandParser` object.
3. `parseCommand("done 1 3")` calls the `parse` method in `DoneCommandParser` which parses the user input into `List<Index>`.
 This is done by calling the methods `parseIndexes` of `ParserUtil`.
4. If the indexes are valid, a `DoneCommand` object will be returned, which takes in `parsedIndexes` of type `List<Index>` containing `Index` `1` and  `3`.
5. There is a return call to `LogicManager` which then calls the overridden `execute` method of `DoneCommand`.
6. The static method `checkForDuplicatedIndexes` of `CommandLogic` is called to check for duplicated indexes.
7. The static method `checkForInvalidIndexes` of  the `CommandLogic` is then called to check for any indexes not found in the displayed assignment list.
8. For each `Index` in `List<Index>`, the assignment in the displayed assignment list corresponding to that index, `assignmentToMarkDone` will be retrieved by calling the `get` method.
9. For each assignment, a new assignment `assignmentMarkedDone` will be created by calling `createAssignmentMarkedDone` with `assignmentToMarkDone`.
10. `setAssignment` method of `model` will be called to replace `assignmentToMarkDone` with `assignmentMarkedDone`.
11. Next, `assignmentToMarkDone` will be added to `List<Assignment>`, `assignmentsToMarkDone`.
12. Since there are only 2 indexes, the loop from step 8 - 11 terminates after 2 times.
13. The `execute` method returns a `CommandResult` object containing the `assignmentsToMarkDone` list. 

Given below is the sequence diagram for the interactions within `LogicManager` for the `execute ("done 1 3")` API call.

   ![Sequence Diagram for DoneCommand](images/DoneMultipleSequenceDiagram.png)
   <br/>*Figure X: Sequence Diagram for DoneCommand*
   
##### Setting reminders to assignments
The usage scenario of a user setting reminders for the first and third assignment in his/her displayed assignment list is similar to the usage scenario above.

Here are the differences:
- In step 2, `parseCommand("remind 1 3")` will return an initialized `RemindCommandParser` object instead of `DoneCommandParser`
- In step 4, a `RemindCommand` object will be returned instead of a `DoneCommand` object
- In step 5, the `LogicManager` will call the overridden `execute` method of `RemindCommand`
- In step 8, Instead of `AssignmentToMarkDone`, the assignment corresponding to each `Index` in `List<Index>` will be named as `AssignmentToRemind`.
- In step 9, A new assignment, `remindedAssignment` will be created by calling `createRemindedAssignment` instead of `createAssignmentMarkedDone`.
- In step 11, instead of `assignmentToMarkDone`, `remindedAssignment` will be added to `List<Assignment>`, `assignmentsToRemind`.
- In step 13, the `CommandResult` object returned by `execute` contains the `assignmentsToRemind` list.

Given below is the sequence diagram for the interactions within `LogicManager` for the `execute ("remind 1 3")` API call.
