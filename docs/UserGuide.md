## Introduction
Welcome to ProductiveNUS User Guide! :blue_book:

**ProductiveNUS is a desktop application** made for you, **a School of Computing (SoC) student in National University of Singapore (NUS)**, to **manage and schedule your academic tasks more effectively**. It makes use of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, which provides you with an intuitive interface and immediate visual feedback. ProductiveNUS uses a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**; this means that you operate the application by typing commands into a [Command Box](#gui-terminologies). If you are fast at typing, you can manage your academic tasks more efficiently.

As a **student from the SoC in NUS**, you tend to have a **heavy workload**. ProductiveNUS helps **improve your productivity** by **enhancing your organisational skills**. Apart from simply **keeping track of your tasks**, ProductiveNUS is capable of **scheduling** them for you so you will never **miss any deadlines**. ProductiveNUS is also compatible with NUSMods, meaning all your **timetable information can be imported easily** into the application so all your academic tasks can be found in just one application.

### Command syntax

All commands and their examples are demarcated with `markups`. `Markups` appear as a grey box as shown.

### Date and time format

All commands with date and/or time parameters have a specific format you must follow, else your input will be deemed as invalid.

#### Date

Date parameters must be in the format `dd-MM-yyyy`, where `dd` is day of the month, `MM` is month and `yyyy` is year. The number of repeated letters indicate the number of digits required for day of the month, month and year. 

For example, `dd` means that the day of the month has to be a 2-digit number. Hence, for dates you want to input from the 1st to the 9th of any month, you must key in `09-01-2020`. `9-01-2020` will be deemed as invalid.

Likewise for month and year, `09-1-2020` and `09-01-20` will be deemed as invalid.

#### Time

Time parameters must be in the format `HHmm`, where `HH` is the hour of the day and `mm` is the minute of the hour. You must input the time according to the 24-hour clock system.

For example, 7:00 AM is `0700` while 7:00 PM is `1900`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:clipboard: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME_OF_ASSIGNMENT`, `NAME_OF_ASSIGNMENT` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Assignment 2`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME_OF_ASSIGNMENT [remind]` can be used as `n/Assignment 2 remind` or as `n/Assignment 2`.


* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME_OF_ASSIGNMENT d/DEADLINE`, `d/DEADLINE n/NAME_OF_ASSIGNMENT` is also acceptable.
  
* All instances of `INDEX` **must be a positive integer**.<br>
  e.g. 1, 2, 3, …​

</div>

### Adding an assignment: `add`

Format: `add n/NAME_OF_ASSIGNMENT d/DEADLINE_OF_ASSIGNMENT TIME_ASSIGNMENT_IS_DUE mod/MODULE​[p/PRIORITY] 
[remind]`

You can add your assignments into your schedule so that you can manage all your assignments and
 academic tasks conveniently. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">
**:bulb: Tip:**
You can include `remind` when adding an assignment instead of using the `remind` command to set reminders after adding an assignment.
</div>

For example, to add a lab report assignment that is **due** on 23th April 2020 12.30pm and **associated** with the module CS2100, you can 
simply enter `add n/Lab report d/23-04-2020 1230 mod/CS2100`. All the information of the assignment will be displayed as shown in the labelled diagram below.
