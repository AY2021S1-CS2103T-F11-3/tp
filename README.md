## Project scope
  
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing your academic tasks.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
## Motivation
* As a NUS Computing Student, you would probably have had **difficulties managing your
academic schedule**. You often feel overwhelmed because you have so many things to do:
**tight deadlines; high workload; many assignments due**. You often **underestimate the time
it takes** to complete your assignments. You are often **late for appointments, lessons**. All these
things just don't get done. You keep spinning your wheels.
* This is exactly why we develop **ProductiveNUS**, an **Academic Schedule Manager** that 
will **solve all these problems**.
### Aim
* Effective time management = **HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY** + **LESS STRESS**.
* **`YOU + TASK + SETTING = PEAK PERFORMANCE`**
* We hope to provide you with the best **SETTING** to manage your academic schedule
so that you can excel in your University Study.

## Current features supported
* Importing timetable from NUSMods
* Adding assignments to ProductiveNUS
* Listing lessons and assignments 
* Deleting assignments from ProductiveNUS
* Reminders for assignments
